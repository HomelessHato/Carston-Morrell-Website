          <h2 class="text-centered">About Me</h2>
          <p class="center"> For my whole life I have been fascinated with technology, especially with computers. During the year of 2021, I discovered all the amazing things that you can build using your computer and coding. It sparked curiosity and intrigue and I discovered a passion for coding and decided that I wanted to pursue this further and make a career out of it. </p>
          <br>

          <p class="center">For the past four years, I have been studying Biotechnology at Utah Valley University. During this period, I was also working part-time for REI because I love the outdoors. I was fortunate enough to learn how to listen to people and aid them effectively in gearing them up for a life outdoors! I learned how to communicate effectively, and work as a teamplayer. I love to help people when I can, and I am positive I can translate this into my future career as a Software Engineer!</p>
